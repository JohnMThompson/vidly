# vidly

Vidly is a Django app from my first python course from Code with Mosh. 
https://codewithmosh.com/

This app contains a small amount of movie data and involved creating an app to see the data as well as an API to access the data in json format. 

~This app is live on Heroku at:
https://lit-springs-01148.herokuapp.com/~

~You can access the api for the movies at this address:
https://lit-springs-01148.herokuapp.com/api/movies~

This app is no longer live since Heroku removed their free tier.
